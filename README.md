# Jafar Billionaire GPT - Expo Project (Full-version skeleton)

This ZIP contains a full-version **Expo React Native project skeleton** for the Jafar trading software.
It includes:
- Login screen (placeholder)
- Dashboard (placeholder)
- Chart screen with sample chart
- Settings & Alerts placeholders (Telegram/Gmail hooks are scaffolded)
- Backend config placeholders (you must supply your backend URLs and API keys)
- Build-ready files for Expo/EAS

## How to use (mobile-only flow)
1. On your mobile, install the **Expo Go** app from Play Store.
2. Upload this ZIP to your Expo account (via the Expo web UI) or:
   - Unzip on a machine with Node.js and run `npm install` then `expo start`.
3. To build an APK (no PC required):
   - Create an account at https://expo.dev
   - From mobile browser, log in and create a new project. Upload this project’s folder (you may need a file manager app).
   - Use **EAS Build** on expo.dev to run a cloud Android build (`eas build -p android`).
   - Expo will return a download link for the built APK that you can open on your phone.

## Quick notes
- Replace placeholders in `src/config.js`:
  - BACKEND_URL, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID, SMTP settings.
- The indicators, auto-trade engine, and broker integration are scaffolded — you (or a developer) must connect real trading APIs (Binance, MT5) and implement secure signing.
